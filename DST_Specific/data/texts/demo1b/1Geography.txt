The Brunntal valley is located in the municipality of Wildalpen (Styria, Austria) within Hochschwab mountain range, which is drained by the Brunnbach, which feeds Lake “Brunnsee” at the end of the valley before its confluence with the Salza river at 640 m.asl. The Brunnbach (municipality Wildalpen, Styria) is a left-bank tributary of the river Salza with a catchment area of 16.3 km². During thunder-storms or prolonged rainfall, the bedload is transported from the steep tributaries via the middle reach to the Brunnsee. 
The catchment area of the Brunnbach lies in the municipality of Wildalpen (District Liezen, Styria) and is part of the Hochschwab mountain range. The altitude at the end of the Brunntal valley at Brunnsee before the confluence with the Salza is 640 m, that of the Brunnboden at the upper end of the middle reach is 820 m. This means that the middle reach has an average gradient of 6.5 % over a flow length of 2.8 km (hm 6.7 to hm 34). The highest point of the catchment area is the Ebenstein with an altitude of 2153 m. The orographic catchment area covers an area of 16.3 km² (Figure 1).

The surrounding cliffs are composed of massive, layered to thick-banked Dachstein limestone and well-stratified to bedded, but heavily fissured main dolomite, which provide large quantities of weathering debris (Flügel and Neubauer, 1984). 
During heavy rainfall, this debris is transported into the Brunn valley via numerous gullies and is deposited on steep cones in the valley area outside the main channel of the Brunnbach. Only the two larger tributaries from the rear catchment area can bring large quantities of debris directly into the middle reach. The valley floor is primarily composed of sedimentary debris from the Brunnbach. The surface of the catchment area is composed of either exposed bedrock or quaternary deposits (60 %) and only the lower slopes and the valley floor is forested (40 %).
