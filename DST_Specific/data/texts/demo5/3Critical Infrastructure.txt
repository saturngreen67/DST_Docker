The Globocica – Shpilje hydroelectric plants hosts several key infrastructure assets that are essential for energy generation, water management, and regional connectivity. These facilities are important for supplying electricity to the national grid and supporting local livelihoods. The region has experienced severe precipitation and drought events in the last years, attributed to climate change effects. At an aftermath, the critical infrastructure is directly exposed to natural hazards such as landslides and rockfalls.

Dam
The Globocica dam is a rock filled dam with a total height of 94,5 m that regulates water storage, sediment transport, and energy production capacity for the hydropower plant (Figure 2). The dam has operated for decades with stable performance records, supported by routine technical inspections and structural monitoring in line with national dam-safety regulations. Maintenance practices include regular spillway testing, concrete surface repair, and instrumentation checks to monitor seepage and deformation. While its structural condition is sound, the location in steep alpine terrain makes it vulnerable to slope instability and increased sediment inflow during extreme events.

Spillway chute
The Globocica spillway chute is a critical hydraulic structure designed to release excess water during periods of high inflow. Maintaining its integrity is essential for overall dam safety. However, the chute is situated directly beneath steep and unstable slopes that are highly susceptible to landslide and rockfall. Past events have caused partial blockages from falling debris, creating operational risks and requiring clearance interventions. Although the spillway is subject to annual inspections and emergency maintenance following heavy rainfall or seismic activity, preventive slope protection remains limited, with only sections of the slope currently covered by protective mesh.

Service Road
The narrow service road is a critical access route to the dam, spillway, and hydropower plant facilities. It is indispensable for staff operations, maintenance works, and emergency response. However, its location along steep slopes makes it particularly exposed to hazards such as landslides, debris flows, and rockfall. Previous events have resulted in temporary blockages, restricting access and delaying maintenance operations. Routine debris removal are performed, but the lack of protective structures, beyond partial mesh coverage, leaves the road vulnerable to repeated disruptions.

Service Operation Building
Adjacent to the dam, the service operation building houses control equipment, monitoring systems, and personnel facilities. It ensures continuous supervision of dam and hydropower operations. The building is structurally sound, equipped with backup power, and maintained through scheduled inspections. 

Spillway Tunnel
The system includes a spillway tunnel that channels water for hydropower production and flood management. These tunnels are designed for high hydraulic capacity and are lined up to resist erosion. Regular inspection and flushing operations are conducted to ensure unobstructed flow. However, tunnel inlets and outlets are at risk from slope failures, which can deposit debris and sediments, reducing operational efficiency. Prolonged blockages could compromise both power generation and flood-control functions.
